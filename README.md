## Overview

EZTest is a lightweight, open-source test management platform built with Next.js and designed for self-hosting. It provides an efficient alternative to commercial tools like Testiny and TestRail, optimized to run on minimal hardware (1 CPU core, 2GB RAM). EZTest combines a modern UI with powerful test management capabilities, featuring project management, test organization, execution tracking, and team collaboration—all deployable with Docker.

## ⚠️ Security Notice for Open Source Project

**IMPORTANT:** This project requires AWS S3 credentials for file attachments. 

🔒 **Never commit real AWS credentials to the repository!**

- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
- ✅ Use `.env.example` as a template (contains placeholders only)
- ✅ For deployment, use environment variables or AWS IAM roles
- ✅ Create a dedicated IAM user with S3-only permissions (see [Attachments Documentation](./docs/features/attachments/README.md))
- ✅ Rotate credentials immediately if accidentally exposed
